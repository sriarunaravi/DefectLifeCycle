Definition:
The Defect Life Cycle is the sequence of states that a defect goes through from the time it is identified until it is closed.
Defect Life Cycle States:
New → Assigned → Open → Fixed → Retest → Verified → Closed
                   ↘ Rejected
                   ↘ Deferred
                   ↘ Duplicate
                   ↘ Reopened
Explanation of Each State:
Status	                     Description
New  	                   Defect is logged by tester
Assigned	               Assigned to developer or team
Open	                   Developer starts working
Fixed	                   Developer fixes the defect
Retest	                 Tester retests the fix
Verified	               Tester confirms defect is fixed
Closed	                 Defect is formally closed
Rejected	               Invalid / not a defect
Deferred	               Fix postponed to future release
Duplicate	               Same defect already reported
Reopened	               Defect still exists after fix
