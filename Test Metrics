Definition
Test Metrics are quantitative measurements used to monitor, control, and improve the testing process and product quality.
Why Test Metrics Are Used:
Measure test progress
Measure software quality
Identify risks
Support management decisions
Types of Test Metrics:
1.Process Metrics
Measure testing efficiency
Test case execution rate
Defect detection rate
2.Product Metrics
Measure product quality
Defect density
Defect severity index
3.Project Metrics
Measure project status
Schedule variance
Effort variance
Example of Test Metric
Defect Density
Defect Density = Total Defects / Size of Software
Example:
Defects = 40
Size = 10 KLOC
Defect Density = 40 / 10 = 4 defects per KLOC
Common Test Metrics Table
Metric Name	                                 Formula
Test Case Execution %	                (Executed / Total) × 100
Defect Leakage	                      (UAT defects / Total defects) × 100
Defect Density	                      Defects / KLOC
Defect Rejection Rate	                (Rejected / Total) × 100
